**About Me**
I’m a passionate Technical Instructor and Data Analyst with 10+ years of experience across education, banking, and tech. Currently, I’m empowering learners at NPower Canada with skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel — helping them break into tech with confidence.

Beyond the classroom, I design data-driven solutions to automate workflows, enhance decision-making, and reduce manual reporting by up to 90%. My strength lies in explaining complex technical concepts simply, and in creating end-to-end analytics systems using Python, Power Automate, and cloud tools.

**Areas of Expertise**
Languages & Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), SQL, Excel, Power BI, JavaScript, C++
Automation: Google Sheets + Python scripting, Power Automate, Salesforce data integration
Data Analytics: EDA, hypothesis testing, dashboards, and storytelling with data
Curriculum Development: Articulate, Coursera, Azure AI & Data Fundamentals
Soft Skills: Technical mentoring, mock interviews, 1:1 coaching, stakeholder presentations

**Featured Projects**
Student Progress Dashboard Automation
Automated student performance tracking using Python and Excel formatting (XlsxWriter), reducing manual reporting time by 90%. Output directly compatible with Blackboard uploads.

Bulk Email & Certificate Automation
Used Python and Power Automate to send bulk emails and auto-generate Coursera certificates with personalized names and timestamps — used at scale across multiple cohorts.

SQL for Performance Analysis
Analyzed training program data (demographics, outcomes) to identify trends and recommend targeted interventions for student success.

**What I'm Teaching Right Now**
